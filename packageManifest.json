Upgrades from version 0.1 should take into account the following manual actions:\n  - to use the Thermostat features in dashboards you should either:\n    -- recreate the sensibo pod devices using the app: remove and then readd (stable option but breaks rules so please ensure that you have a copy of rules before performing this step), OR\n    -- uncomment the line capability 'Initialize' in the driver code, restart your hub and then comment out the line again (developer option - USE AT OWN RISK)\n  - any rules using the modeCool custom command should be changed to use the Cool custom command",
